# Cities Sample App

Tech Stack: SAP CAP(Node.JS) / SAP UI5.<br/>
To start it locally:

- install modules via `npm run init`
- run `cds watch` or `npm run watch-cities` to open the app automatically.

App is also deployed to my trial BTP account, so it should be also available [here](https://65c8f6cctrial.launchpad.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/site?siteId=c3dabb7c-2a3e-4c95-a351-8a0643a2daf0#Shell-home).
